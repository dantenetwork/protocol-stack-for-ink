# protocol-stack-for-ink

This it the first step of Dante protocol stack for Polkadot.

Let's start with `ink!`. 


## Develop record
### Currently
#### Developing
* The development of algoritms in ink! smart contract:
    * Message verification;
    * Routers evalustion;

#### Finished
* Development of the first version of message defination, and test it on local substrate node.
* Development and test of Basic communication components including:
    * Sending message or contract invocation from ink! smart contracts to other chains(like EVM chains, Near).
    * Receiving message or contract invocation from other chains(like EVM chains, Near).
* Simulation and testing of some of the algorithms:
    * Routers selection in ink! smart contract.
    * Staking and slashing in ink! smart contract.
    * Message verification in other technology stack.
    * Routers evaluation in other technology stack.

#### Next step
* Try to deploy and test on *AStar* Testnet.
* SDK(first version) for ink! smart contracts.
* Related docs.
